# Angular Mobile Toolkit in action

This is the demo of Mobile Toolkit for pre-"--mobile flag enabled" era. It was created for the half-day workshop given at ngPoland (ask twitter.com/webmaxru for the full workshop document with detailed instructions and explanations, if you need it).

**In usage**
- @angular/service-worker (static caching, gulpGenerateManifest, gulpAddStaticFiles)
- @angular/app-shell
- AoT
- Closure Compiler
- Angular Universal (for app shell)

**Run (use Yarn only!)**

-	yarn install
-	gulp build
-	gulp serve

**Thanks for help**
- Alex Rickabaugh (Angular Team)
